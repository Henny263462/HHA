# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — Tome of Abilities & fixes (2026-07-15)

### Added
- Tome of Abilities: an in-game guide book (12 localized pages, EN/DE) explaining sets, controls, actives and Ultra Mode; craft it from a book + blaze powder + feather (`guide_book_recipe` toggle), or grab it from the creative tab

### Changed
- Keybinds are now listed as "Ability 1" (set beam), "Ability 2" (Fire Camp) and "Ability 3" (Ultra) in the controls menu; lore, `/info` texts and the book reference them accordingly
- Halo (Heaven's Helmet) now grants Regeneration only to trusted players in range instead of everyone

### Fixed
- Magma Stomp lava pools now clean themselves up reliably: on expiry the placed sources and any lava that flowed away from them are removed (natural lava sources are left untouched)

## 0.1.0 — Addon system (2026-07-15)

### Addon system
- Addons are regular Fabric mods that hook into HHA via the new `"hha"` entrypoint (optional `"hha_client"` for HUD) — see `ADDONS.md` and `docs/`
- Public API under `dev.henny.hha.api`: armor-set registry with builder DSL and tick hooks, ability registry bound to the existing keybinds, item registration helpers
- Events: `ABILITY_CAST` (cancellable), `PLAYER_TICK`, `FULL_SET_CHANGED`, `SHOULD_HARM`/`IS_FRIENDLY` overrides
- Addon config keys (`<addonid>.<key>`) live in `config/hha.json` and work with `/hha list|toggle|set|get`
- Addons can add slots to the cooldown HUD with their own icon and accent color
- Internally, the built-in Heaven/Hell sets and abilities now register through the same registries
